You will find below the different projects I realised or participated in the last years.

1. **MCQBot**

    MCQBot, or Multiple Choice Questions Bot is a simple NLP project I realized in June 2018. The idea is pretty simple, given a question and a set of answers, make a bot that can gives a confidence score to each choice in order to reply to the question. Number of choices is not fixed.

    Current method is pretty simple, n-grams occurrences-based, from google search content, but working quite efficiently. You can find the code on my github [here](https://github.com/RafaelCartenet/MCQbot)

    I have been running my bot over a small dataset of french questions and **accuracy** is about **85%**.

    In future work, accuracy could be increased using semantic analysis or smarter search of content using different source (such as Wikipedia for example), and/or different method (key words search rather than complete question search).

    Finally, such **"close field"** question answering method could be expanded to **"open field"** questions by generating a range of potential choices.
    For example, for questions such as `Which european country ... ?`, we could generate the list of choices (all european countries), and score each of them using this method.

2. **STMVN Normalization**

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)
