Hello, I am Rafael Cartenet from Normandy, France. I am a Machine-Learning R&D Engineer currently working for [Openfield](http://openfieldlive.com/?lang=en) in Paris, since June 2018.

I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandy with a Master of Engineering in April 2018, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I completed an internship in Shanghai China between August 2017 and February 2018, as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called Mediasia-Labs. I have been working on Computational Linguistics, and Emotions Recognition.

I studied abroad for a year, in [KAIST Korea](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/kaist/kaist_010201.html), where I specialized in Machine-Learning.
