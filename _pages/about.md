Hello, I am Rafael Cartenet from Normandy, France. I am a Machine-Learning R&D Engineer currently working for [Openfield](http://openfieldlive.com/?lang=en) in Paris, since June 2018.

I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandy with a Master of Engineering, in April 2018 majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I completed an internship in Shanghai, China, between August 2017 and February 2018, as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called Mediasia-Labs, working on Computational Linguistics, and Emotions Recognition.
