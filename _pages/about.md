# My history

I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandy with a Master of Engineering in April 2018, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

I completed an internship in Shanghai China between August 2017 and February 2018, as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called Mediasia-Labs. I have been working on Deep-Learning and Advanced Algorithms applied to Pronounciation Evaluation.

I studied abroad for a year, in [KAIST Korea](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/kaist/kaist_010201.html), where I specialized in Machine-Learning. I had the chance to study NLP, Computer Vision as well as Search Based Algorithms.
