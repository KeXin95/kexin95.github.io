# My history

I graduated from INSA Rouen Normandy with a Master of Engineering in April 2018, majoring in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

I completed my end of study internship in Shanghai China between August 2017 and February 2018, as a Machine Learning R&D Engineer for a sino-french startup called Mediasia-Labs. I have been working on Deep-Learning and Advanced Algorithms applied to Pronunciation Evaluation.

I studied abroad for a year in the global university of [KAIST](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/kaist/kaist_010201.html) in South-Korea , where I specialized in Machine-Learning. I completed my initial background with skills in NLP, Computer Vision as well as Search-Based Algorithms.
