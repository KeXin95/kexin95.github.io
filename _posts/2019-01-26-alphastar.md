**They did it!** DeepMind, the successful inventors of AlphaGo, the AI that bit the professional korean player Lee Sedol, just released a new amazing AI agent: AlphaStar, for the well-known strategy game Starcraft 2, created by Blizzard.
As a huge fan of DeepMind for what they've achieved so far and an ex amateur player of the game, I followed these events meticulously, and I must say I got completely amazed by this "prototype" they just revealed on January 24th.

If you are a fan of AI and never heard of DeepMind, you're missing out something. Founded in 2010 by top AI researchers on the planet, they dedicated themselves mainly on a promising field, called Reinforcement Learning. In the history of technology, steps have been achieved by the invention of new machines, new mechanisms or molecules that scientists would discover. Nowadays, rules have changed a little bit, AI research's milestones are usually achieved thanks to new AI agents winning over human players on games, more complicated each time. That might sound weird, but it is actually pretty legit if you think about it.
Players develop strong problem solving skills when mastering the game. Every decision a human takes when taking an action in a game is itself the result of an algorithm, just like Yuval Noah Harari likes to mention in his book [Homo Deus](https://www.ynharari.com/book/homo-deus/). All the decisions we take come from the result of a decision-making process that runs inside our brain. In a simple game like chess, the entire possible actions is quite limited as the board is relatively small, but in your everyday life, the number of actions you can take, is infinite.

The first impressive AI agent that could beat pro players was [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer), a Chess AI that defeated Kasparov, the at-the-time world champion. DeepMind started with simple games, including [Atari Games](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/playing-atari-deep-reinforcement-learning/), the [Go Game](https://deepmind.com/research/alphago/) with the recent new ultimate version [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/).
The order of these developments is really important. 



More recently, DeepMind has been part the occidental trend: AI ethics. As many people, including AI researchers, got worried about the turn AI was taking in certain domains, many researchers and engineers dedicated their careers to use or develop AI in good ethical manners, that would help citizens' life in a non-lucratic way, rather shorting off jobs. This seems to be pretty promising for the next decades, we might see some potential huge changes in the way we think of AI, and particularly the way we want to deal with it in our everyday life.
