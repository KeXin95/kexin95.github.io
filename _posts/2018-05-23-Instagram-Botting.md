My experience about Instagram Automation, or "Botting".

# What are we talking about ?

Instagram Automation, or Botting, is the action to automate tasks a user would do on Instagram. Actions you can perform on Instagram are rather simple, like a post, comment a post, follow an user, unfollow an user, post a post, delete a post etc.

I have been botting around on Instagram for more than a year now.

I made my own custom bot based on a pretty efficient API-wrapper, called [instabot](https://github.com/instagrambot/instabot).
You can find several of them on the internet, depending on your favorite coding language etc. These APIs often also provide some scripts in order to demo their API's key features. These repositories sometimes even provide a script that would run 24h and automate basic actions, such as liking celebrities' followers, unfollowing your non-followers followings etc.

However, let's face it, most Instagram Automation scripts available over the internet are really often pretty simple, and are not as effective as you would expect. This said, if you're still thinking about getting into botting, you have two options:

- Use some premade scripts that would do the job for you, select the proposed features you want and accept the results.
- Or make your own scripts to do the tasks you want, specific strategies that you imagined etc. That implies of course that you are able to code, and that you have time to spend on building it.

# My advise to get into Instagram Botting

The key features you want your bot to have are:
- Easy monitoring
- Efficient actions
- Low risk strategy
- Steady process, that can run over days

Easy Monitoring

Monitoring your whole botting is really important. It would never be as steady as you would like, as a matter of fact, it is pretty hard to have a working script 24/7, for these reasons keeping track of what is going on over time is really important. Here are two interesting examples, that I eventually experienced:
- If you launch your script on Monday, check its status again on Friday and find out it actually mysteriously stopped on Tuesday, you lost three days of botting, which is a shame.
- Now let's imagine you are checking your script status every 30 minutes, then you are gonna be of course catching every single anomaly, but you are going to spending way too much unnecessary time on this.
Building yourself a tool to monitor the whole activity is really important.

# Conclusion

Making an Instagram Robot may seem a bit shameful, as it is pretty controversial and but it is not. It is actually pretty smart and the skills you develop working on that
- Errors handling:
Handling errors (numerous of them) in a smart way is a pretty cool skill to have when you need to handle continuous script run. Having a script running 24h a day is much more complicated than it seems, and you're gonna encounter some errors you maybe didn't think about.
- Scheduled tasks:
Most of bots got a set of different actions, that sometimes need to occur simultaneously. Handling them, giving them priorities etc. can sometimes be tricky.

2 types of automation
AUTO POSTING VS AUTO EVERYTHING

# Legal aspects
It is well known and written everywhere, automating Instagram is prohibited. We all experienced accounts interacting with us with weird comments, sometimes completely neutral, sometimes completely out of context regarding your post.

People are usually ashamed
