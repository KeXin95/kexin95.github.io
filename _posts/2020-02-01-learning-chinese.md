# Flashcards

Learning a new language in general, takes time and energy, and constant practice. Chinese has different origin than my mother tongue (french) and it thus makes it harder to memorize the vocabulary that you will learn. Chinese's logic and etymology are completely different than latin based languages.

I found myself struggling remembering some words that I could not find similar to my language, which is what you normally what you do when you learn a language close to your.

I read a lot of articles about how to be more efficient at learning a language as it can be really time consuming.

One thing i found many times recommended on the internet were flashcards.
