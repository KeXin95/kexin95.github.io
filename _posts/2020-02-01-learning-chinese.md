# Flashcards

Learning a new language in general, takes time and energy, and constant practice. Chinese has different origin than my mother tongue (french) and it thus makes it harder to memorize the vocabulary that you will learn. Chinese's logic and etymology are completely different than latin based languages.

I found myself struggling remembering some words that I could not find similar to my language, which is what you normally what you do when you learn a language close to your.

I read a lot of articles about how to be more efficient at learning a language as it can be really time consuming.

One thing i found many times recommended on the internet were flashcards. Flashcards are a simple method, a front and back card. Front is whatever you are trying to memorize, it could be a word, sentence but could also be a sound, an image etc. On the back is the solution, it's what should come to your mind when you see the front.

Once you flip the card you get to see the solution and grade your result. You are giving the grade yourself, it is no point to cheat, you'd better be honest if you wanna improve! The app i am using has 4 grades _fail, hard, good_ and _easy_.

Here is an example, from the app _AnkiApp_.

| Front         | Back           |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| ![front]({{ '/images/flashcard_front.png' | relative_url }}) | ![back]({{ '/images/flashcard_back.png' | relative_url }})  |

Once you chose a grade it goes to the next card and so on until you reviewed N cards, N being a setting that you can change, usually from 10 to 20.
The good thing about it is that you'll tend to be given the cards that you did not memorize, i.e. the cards you gave _fail_ or _hard_. This way you won't spend too much time on the cards you know but mainly on the ones you don't, even if sometimes it will give you cards you graded _easy_ just to make sure you didn't forget it!

There are plenty of flashcards app you can use online, most famous being [**Anki**](https://apps.ankiweb.net) and [**AnkiApp](https://www.ankiapp.com).
They both have a mobile and desktop version with account management that lets you revise your own decks on both platforms.
I personally prefer AnkiApp as it got a free version on MacOS, which is not the case for Anki, it's about 25 bucks.

Great thing about both those apps is that they usually have a nice "marketplace", with a lot of people creating and sharing decks that you can download and instantly use on your device! For example, for HSK (official chinese language exam), you can find plenty of cards for the vocabulary (official vocabulary list). However as soon as you want to create your own cards
