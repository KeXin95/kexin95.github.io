## Previous work experiences

- **Senior Data Scientist** - Advance.AI (Singapore):  
  

- **Data Scientist** - Jewel Paymentech (Singapore):  
  At Jewel Paymentech, I focused on fast prototyping and managing the end-to-end productionization of trained models for proof-of-concept (POC) purposes, supporting new business initiatives with quick and effective solutions. My responsibilities included **gathering requirements from stakeholders, developing entire ML systems, training text classification/anomaly detection models, and deploying them into production by containerised them into API/kafka consumer**. Additionally, I **built an in-house interactive dashboard using Bokeh**, which allowed the internal fraud team to effectively monitor and compare web content changes over time. Most of my projects were deployed using Docker, ensuring scalability and seamless integration.

## Education
