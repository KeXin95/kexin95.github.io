## About me

Data Scientist | Deriving Risk Insights & Payment Intelligence from Social and Transactional Data

---
I am a Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) student at Georgia Institute of Technology, specializing in Machine Learning, with a strong focus on applying AI to financial risk management and security. My work involves developing innovative AI solutions to mitigate risks and enhance decision-making in fintech. Given my interest in enhancing security and transparency in financial systems, I am also exploring the potential of blockchain technology and how AI can be leveraged within it for risk management. I am eager to contribute to research opportunities in these areas.
